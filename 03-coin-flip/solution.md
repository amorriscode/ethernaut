# Coin Flip

This is a coin flipping game where you need to build up your winning streak by guessing the outcome of a coin flip. To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract CoinFlip {
  uint256 public consecutiveWins;
  uint256 lastHash;
  uint256 FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;

  function CoinFlip() public {
    consecutiveWins = 0;
  }

  function flip(bool _guess) public returns (bool) {
    uint256 blockValue = uint256(block.blockhash(block.number-1));

    if (lastHash == blockValue) {
      revert();
    }

    lastHash = blockValue;
    uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
    bool side = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;

    if (side == _guess) {
      consecutiveWins++;
      return true;
    } else {
      consecutiveWins = 0;
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution

1. Copied the contract code so I could "predict" the next flip using the same code
2. Ran my CoinFlipPredictor on Remix 10 times
3. Confirmed consecutive 10 wins using `await contract.consecutiveWins()`

_Note: I used an abstract contract which appears to be the [preferred method for calling contracts](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/11481). This is because `call` and friends break the type-safety of Solidity._
