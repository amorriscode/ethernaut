# Privacy

The creator of this contract was careful enough to protect the sensitive areas of its storage.

Unlock this contract to beat the level.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Privacy {

  bool public locked = true;
  uint256 public constant ID = block.timestamp;
  uint8 private flattening = 10;
  uint8 private denomination = 255;
  uint16 private awkwardness = uint16(now);
  bytes32[3] private data;

  function Privacy(bytes32[3] _data) public {
    data = _data;
  }
  
  function unlock(bytes16 _key) public {
    require(_key == bytes16(data[2]));
    locked = false;
  }

## Solution

Nothing in the blockchain is private.

`locked`, `flattening`, and `denomination` take up one storage slot. `awkwardness` takes up another slot. Then we have an array that takes up three more slots. Knowing this, we can access `data[2]` by peeking at the third slot.

1. Take a peek at `data[2]` using `privacy.js`
2. Call the `unlock` method with the data in `bytes16(data[2])`
